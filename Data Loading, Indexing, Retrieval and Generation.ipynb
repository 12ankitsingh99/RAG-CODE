Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\\nneighbors.

The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.

Everyone out!\"\\n\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea.

Smaller and more efficient Language Models\\nThis is a survey on large language models, and there\\nhas been an initial push towards ”larger is better” that has\\nclearly been rewarded with ever larger models like GPT-\\n4 getting better accuracy and performance in benchmarks.\\nHowever, those large models are costly and inefficient in'),\n",

Open Source Toolkits For LLM Development and\\nDeployment\\nThere are various frameworks and libraries developed for\\nLLM training, evaluation, and deployment, and covering every\\nsingle framework is out of this paper’s scope.

LLM Training/Inference Frameworks\\nSome of the popular frameworks which are useful for LLM\\ntraining includes (note that some of them can be used beyond\\nLLM training too):\\nDeepSpeed [220] is a deep learning optimization library\\nthat makes distributed training and inference easy, efficient,'),\n",
